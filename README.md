# Timeline: Weekly Meeting Goals  

**Q2:** What is your goals that your group want to achieve in each weekly meeting?  
**Example:**  
*Prior to 3/13: Weekly Meeting we will plan out some preliminary info/idea for the project itself ahead of the scheduled meeting like which data source/API and data structures we will use in our backend. We will browse [the given list of public APIs for inspiration](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).*  

*During week of 3/25: Work on the project rough draft itself to make a functioning project with data input, data structure usage, and processing into output on the frontend.*  

*Prior to 4/17: Meet together weekly to target project weakpoints/bugs and possibly visit office hours to get guidance if the progress feels weak.*

# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  
*Our group will handle situations when there is a conflict in our group by communicating with each other on Discord and on our online meeting. We will make sure the everyone is on the same page and figure out how to resolve the conflict. 
**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  
* Our group will handle situations when a member is not contributing enough by contacting that member and ensuring that they need to complete their part of the work that was assigned to them. We will each have assigned parts of the group project and will be responsible to complete them by a certain deadline that will be set by us. This will be done by using Jira to ensure that every member understands what needs to be done by when. If the member isn't contributing because they are struggling with their part, we will make sure to help them in order to motivate that member to contribute to their part.

**Example:**  
*If there is conflict, we will meet up and discuss and resolve the conflict. Conflict can also be just misunderstanding.*
*If a student believes another student is not pulling their weight, or if there is any difficulty working together, they must bring it up so that we can resolve it ASAP. Resolving team issues early prevents it from going out of control.*
*We will be using Jira to split responsibilities and agree on each person's duty beforehand, allowing clarity and avoiding a team member underworking or overworking.*

# Tech Stacks

**Q6:** Which tech stacks will your group use? (Django + React or Flask + React)
*We decided to use React for the frontend, and Flask for backend.

# Full Stack Group Project Track

# Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences
**Problem 1:** A common problem during this decade has been how AI apps are keeping people's data secure. Large AI models often take in users' data and manage connections with third-party apps to discover more about the user than was previiously known to them. This is especially a concern of older populations 

**Solution 1:** Our solution is to build a lightweight LLM app that filters incoming requests and monitors connections to AI models in the web browser. The LLM is localized to respect the individual user, and trained to summarize user-AI relationships at the base level.

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:**
*As, a UIC student, it can be very tedious and difficult to plan out your next semester and what classes you should take. Class description on the UIC website is very outdated. As a student, you need to go to reddit, student discord servers, and even ask around to get the most up to date information for every single class you are interested in taking. You may also want to balance the difficulty of each semester based on your current situation. E.g. this semester you're also working part time and want to more relax semester. You would then have to go to uicgrades.com or ratemyproffesor to gauge how difficult the class you're interested in taking could be.*

**Solution 2:** 
*Our solution is a UIC Classes Wikipedia for students that acts as a one stop shop for all the information students need to plan out their next semester informed and with confidence. The wikipedia will be updated by UIC students who took the class beforehand. They can write descriptions, add comments, and even be able to converse with other students on classes. Each class will have its own dedicated page that will also include the grade distribution of previous semesters and which professors have taught it in the past, with links to RateMyProfessor.The app will focus on CS classses, but may expand to include other classes as well. It may also have other features, including an interactive flowchart for students to mark what classes they already took. The flowchart can also recommend what classes to take based on the classes the user already took as well.

**Problem 3:** 
*In the computer science field, one of the main things when getting a job is the technical interviews, therefore, it's important to practice the process of a technical interview. At UIC, there isn't a way for UIC CS students to practice technical interviews with each other. While there are external websites and applications such as Pramper for CS students to practice technical interviews with students from other colleges and professionals in the computer science field, there isn't a specific application for UIC CS students. It would be better if UIC CS students practice technical interviews with each other because UIC CS students have an idea of what they learned from taking the same classes, so each student would have an idea of what that student knows about the question. Not having this type of application results in not having enough resources for UIC CS students to prepare for technical interviews. 

**Solution 3:**  
*Our solution is a UIC CS Technical Interview Prep application for UIC CS students where they can practice technical interviews with each other. UIC CS students will be able to join an online session, via Zoom, to interview each other one-on-one. There will also be a rubric that the student who is interviewing the other student will fill out during the interview. The rubric will consist of categories that are scored in a technical interview, in which the person being interviewed will recieve the rubric after the interview. There will be certain technical questions that are seperated by questions that might be asked by certain companies. There will be other features within the application that will help with UIC CS students in finding a job/internship, such as a job board and an announcements page.

# Idea Finalization

**From 5 project ideas you have above, please choose one of the project that you are going with for the rest of the semester. Explain why you are going with that project**

*We are going to work on the UIC Class Wikipedia for students. We believe that this will provide the most value to the UIC community, and we can easily get users who will find a lot of value in this project. We already had some meetings and really fleshed out this idea as well.*

# Extra Credit (Only do this if you are done with Idea Finalization)

## Database Design

**Q1: What database are you using for your project (SQLite, PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDB,...), and why do you choose it?**

**Q2: How will database be helpful to your project? How will you design your database to support your application features?**

## Third-Party API Integration

**Q3: Which third-party API(s) will you integrate into your project? What data will you pull from the API(s), and how will you use it in your application?**
*We are thinking of using Firebase Authentication as one of our third-party API. We will pull user authentication data from Firebase Authentication to securely manage sign-up, login, and session tracking.*



**Q4: Does your API key has limitations such as rate limits or downtime? How are you going to deal with that?**

## Authentication and Security

**Q5: What authentication method will you use (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT)?**
*As stated from above, we are going to us Firebase Authentication for secure username/password-based logins.*

**Q6: How will you store and protect sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, tokens)?** The APIs we use should be listed in .env files and ignored outright from public commits via .gitignore. Additionally, any tokens we use should be processed through GitHub, accessible through all members, and managed locally, if need be.

## Deployment

**Q7: Where will you deploy your project (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render)? How will you manage environment variables and secrets during deployment?**
*Currently, we are strongly considering using AWS to deploy our project. We will manage environemntal variables by using it on an EC2 instance's environment or ultilizing AWS Secrets Manager.*

**Q8: How will you ensure your deployment is reliable and easy to update?** During the latter phases of user testing and final revisions, we will periodically monitor our live deployment through AWS dashboards.
