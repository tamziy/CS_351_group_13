# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:**
*As, a UIC student, it can be very tedious and difficult to plan out your next semester and what classes you should take. Class description on the UIC website is very outdated. As a student, you need to go to reddit, student discord servers, and even ask around to get the most up to date information for every single class you are interested in taking. You may also want to balance the difficulty of each semester based on your current situation. E.g. this semester you're also working part time and want to more relax semester. You would then have to go to uicgrades.com or ratemyproffesor to gauge how difficult the class you're interested in taking could be.*

**Solution 2:** 
*A UIC Classes Wikipedia for students that acts as a one stop shop for all the information students need to plan out their next semester informed and with confidence. The wikipedia will be updated by UIC students who took the class beforehand. They can write descriptions, add comments, and even be able to converse with other students on classes. Each class will have its own dedicated page that will also include the grade distribution of previous semesters and which professors have taught it in the past.*
