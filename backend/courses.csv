1,111,"Program Design I","Introduction to programming: control structures; variables and data types; problem decomposition and procedural programming; input and output; aggregate data structures including arrays; programming exercises.","Intro to basic programming with Python. Weed out class, if you pass Reckinger's material with at least a B, you will be in a good spot for 141.","Mitchell Theys",3,"None Specified","None Specified","None Specified",4
2,141,"Program Design II","Data abstraction and modular design; recursion; lists and stacks; dynamic memory allocation; file manipulation; programming exercises. Course Information: 3 hours. Previously listed as CS 102. Extensive computer use required.","Intro to more advanced programming with C++. Teaches concepts such as pointers, memory management, etc. Doing well in this class will build the foundation for 211 and 251.","Mitchell Theys",3,"None Specified","CS 111; MATH 180","None Specified",4
3,151,"Mathematical Foundations of Computing","Discrete mathematics concepts fundamental to computing: propositional logic, predicates and quantifiers; proofs; sets; recursive definitions and induction; functions, relations and graphs; combinatorics and discrete probability; applications.","Logic and Proof class. Very chill class regardless of prof.","Daniel Ayala; Zoa Katok",3,"None Specified","CS 111; MATH 180","None Specified",4
4,211,"Programming Practicum","Software development tools and practices; debugging and testing; advanced language features; standard libraries; code management.","Learning basic data structures through coding them up in C and applying them. Projects take up a lot of time so plan schedule accordingly and don't keep them to the last day.","",3,"None Specified","CS 141","None Specified",5
5,251,"Data Structures","Design, usage and analysis of data structures: review of lists, stacks and queues; hash tables, priority queues, search trees, introduction to graphs; searching and sorting; runtime analysis; programming projects and lab exercises.","Learning data structures through using them as the base in C++ to build more advanced programs. Projects take up a lot of time so plan schedule accordingly and don't keep them to the last day.","None Specified",4,"None Specified","CS 141; CS 151","None Specified",5
6,261,"Machine Organization","Data representation and computer arithmetic; machine language; addressing; memory hierarchy; subroutines; data structures; processor architecture: hardware components, pipelining.","Binary, Assembly, and low-level stuff. Not much actual coding, more understanding of concepts. Probably the hardest class below 300.","None Specified",4,"None Specified","CS 211","None Specified",5
7,277,"Technical and Professional Communication in Computer Science","Communication skills for computing students and professionals in various contexts: technical writing, portfolios, job interviews, demos, sales, with speech organization, visuals, and delivery.","Communication, networking (LinkedIn), portfolio building (GitHub), resume writing, and interview preparation (LeetCode etc). This is a very easy class with a generous number of drops and make ups that prepares you to start working in the industry. Perfect to take in the spring semester to start applying for internships in summer.","None Specified",3,"None Specified","CS 141","None Specified",5
8,301,"Languages and Automata","Regular sets and finite automata. Context-free languages and push-down automata. Parsing. Computability theory including Turing machines and decidability.","Builds off of 151 as another theory class with automata and state machines. Concepts are more complex than 151's, but not impossible. Will need to know how to write proofs from 151 unless you have DasGupta.","None Specified",4,"None Specified","CS 151; CS 251","None Specified",5
9,341,"Programming Language Design and Implementation","Programming language paradigms, design and implementation: syntax and semantics; parsing; runtime systems; control; data types; subroutines and exceptions; data and procedural abstraction; functional programming.","SQL, Python, F# (database querying and functional programming). Concept-wise, this class is pretty easy, most people manage to finish the hw and projects with high grades. The exams are tricky since not enough time given unless your understanding of the material is solid.","None Specified",3,"None Specified","CS 211; CS 251","None Specified",5
10,342,"Software Design","Software design principles and practices: Object-oriented design; design patterns; software reuse; testing; event driven programming and concurrency; graphical user interface design and development; Team development.","Object-oriented programming using Java. Honestly the best class in the 300s for SWE. Changed my perspective on planning how to write the code and made it more organized.","None Specified",3,"None Specified","CS 211; CS 251","None Specified",5
11,361,"Systems Programming","Study of computer systems emphasizing impact on application level programming. Virtual memory and memory management; code optimization; system-level I/O; concurrency: processes, threads, synchronization; introduction to network programming.","Focuses on low-level computer software stuff with harder theory, building off of 261. Hands down the hardest CS class at UIC below 400. Expect to spend a lot of time per week for the homework/projects and understanding the material.","None Specified",4,"None Specified","CS 261","None Specified",5
12,362,"Computer Design","Computer hardware building blocks. logic gates; combinational circuits; arithmetic circuits; flip flops and sequential circuits; registers and memory; CPU design; I/O design.","Arduino coding, more of an Electrical Engineering class tbh. Teaches about logic gates and low level hardware stuff. If you have Diaz, do good on the midterm and you only need to care about your project after that, can skip the final.","None Specified",4,"CS 261","None Specified","None Specified",5
13,377,"Ethical Issues in Computing","Communication skills for computing professionals: presentation organization, visual aides, delivery techniques, argument support. Ethical and societal issues in computing: privacy, intellectual property and ownership, crime.","Ethics class. Definitely take Clayville over Burton if you want easier life.","None Specified",3,"None Specified","CS 251","None Specified",5
