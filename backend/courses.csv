1,111,"Program Design I","Introduction to programming: control structures; variables and data types; problem decomposition and procedural programming; input and output; aggregate data structures including arrays; programming exercises.","Intro to basic programming with Python. Weed out class, if you pass Reckinger's material with at least a B, you will be in a good spot for 141.","Franke; Gonzalo Bello",3,"None Specified","N/A","None Specified",4
2,141,"Program Design II","Data abstraction and modular design; recursion; lists and stacks; dynamic memory allocation; file manipulation; programming exercises. Course Information: 3 hours. Previously listed as CS 102. Extensive computer use required.","Intro to more advanced programming with C++. Teaches concepts such as pointers, memory management, etc. Doing well in this class will build the foundation for 211 and 251.","Zhaochen Gu",3,"None Specified","CS 111; MATH 180 (N/A)","None Specified",3
3,151,"Mathematical Foundations of Computing","Discrete mathematics concepts fundamental to computing: propositional logic, predicates and quantifiers; proofs; sets; recursive definitions and induction; functions, relations and graphs; combinatorics and discrete probability; applications.","Logic and Proof class. Very chill class regardless of prof.","Drishika Dey; Omar Ibrahim",3,"None Specified","CS 111; MATH 180 (N/A)","None Specified",2
4,211,"Programming Practicum","Software development tools and practices; debugging and testing; advanced language features; standard libraries; code management.","Learning basic data structures through coding them up in C and applying them. Projects take up a lot of time so plan schedule accordingly and don't keep them to the last day.","Mark Hodges; Scott Reckinger",3,"None Specified","CS 141","None Specified",3
5,251,"Data Structures","Design, usage and analysis of data structures: review of lists, stacks and queues; hash tables, priority queues, search trees, introduction to graphs; searching and sorting; runtime analysis; programming projects and lab exercises.","Learning data structures through using them as the base in C++ to build more advanced programs. Projects take up a lot of time so plan schedule accordingly and don't keep them to the last day.","Daniel Ayala; Mitchell Theys",4,"None Specified","CS 141; CS 151","None Specified",3
6,261,"Machine Organization","Data representation and computer arithmetic; machine language; addressing; memory hierarchy; subroutines; data structures; processor architecture: hardware components, pipelining.","Binary, Assembly, and low-level stuff. Not much actual coding, more understanding of concepts. Probably the hardest class below 300.","Adam Koehler",4,"None Specified","CS 211","None Specified",4
7,277,"Technical and Professional Communication in Computer Science","Communication skills for computing students and professionals in various contexts: technical writing, portfolios, job interviews, demos, sales, with speech organization, visuals, and delivery.","Communication, networking (LinkedIn), portfolio building (GitHub), resume writing, and interview preparation (LeetCode etc). This is a very easy class with a generous number of drops and make ups that prepares you to start working in the industry.","Jordan Carson; Cody Cranch",3,"None Specified","CS 141","None Specified",1
8,301,"Languages and Automata","Regular sets and finite automata. Context-free languages and push-down automata. Parsing. Computability theory including Turing machines and decidability.","Builds off of 151 as another theory class with automata and state machines. Concepts are more complex than 151's, but not impossible. Will need to know how to write proofs from 151 unless you have DasGupta.","Zoa Katok; Gonzalo Bello",4,"None Specified","CS 151; CS 251","None Specified",3
9,341,"Programming Language Design and Implementation","Programming language paradigms, design and implementation: syntax and semantics; parsing; runtime systems; control; data types; subroutines and exceptions; data and procedural abstraction; functional programming.","SQL, Python, F#, functional programming, and database querying. Concept-wise, pretty easy; exams are tricky unless understanding is solid.","Shanon Reckinger",3,"None Specified","CS 211; CS 251","None Specified",2
10,342,"Software Design","Software design principles and practices: object-oriented design; design patterns; software reuse; testing; event-driven programming and concurrency; GUI development; team development.","Object-oriented programming using Java. The best 300-level class for SWE.","Mark Hallenbeck",3,"None Specified","CS 211; CS 251","None Specified",3
11,361,"Systems Programming","Study of computer systems emphasizing impact on application-level programming: virtual memory, memory management, code optimization, system-level I/O, concurrency, processes, threads, synchronization, networking.","Hardest CS class below 400.
